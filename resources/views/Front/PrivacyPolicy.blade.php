                        being used. This information is essential for us to enhance the overall user experience. It's

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Social Buttons and Data Collection Notice</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Throughout our website, you'll come across "social buttons" that enable users to share or
                        bookmark web pages. To implement these buttons and connect them to the relevant social
                        networks and external sites, we use scripts from domains outside of our own. It's important to
                        be aware that these external sites are likely to collect information about your online activities
                        across the internet.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">When you interact with these social buttons, such as clicking on them, these external sites will
                        record those actions and may use that data for various purposes. Additionally, in some cases,
                        these external sites may log your visit to our site and the specific pages you access, even if you
                        don't click on the social buttons, especially if you are logged into their services, such as Google
                        and Facebook
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">We recommend that you review the individual privacy policies of each of these external sites
                        to understand how they use your information and to learn how to opt out of or delete such
                        information if you wish to do so. Your online privacy is important, and we want to ensure that
                        you are informed about how these external sites handle your data.

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="mb-4">External Web Services and Data Collection Disclosure</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">We employ several external web services primarily to display content within our web pages.
                        Similar to the case of social buttons, it's important to note that we cannot prevent these external
                        sites or domains from gathering information regarding your interaction with embedded content
                        on our website.

                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">When you are not logged into these external services, they will not have access to your identity.
                        However, they may still collect anonymous usage data, such as the number of views, plays,
                        loads, and other relevant usage information.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">While your personal identity may remain undisclosed in these cases, we want to make you
                        aware that these external services may track anonymous usage data related to the content you
                        interact with. This helps us ensure the functionality and relevance of the embedded content
                        while respecting your privacy.

                    <p class="mb-4">To facilitate online payment processing, we necessitate the billing address associated with the
                        credit card used for the transaction. Additionally, our external payment provider, JAKS Travels
                        Ltd, requires access to your credit card details for payment processing purposes.


                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">It's important to emphasize that the security and confidentiality of your credit card information
                        are of utmost importance to us and our payment provider. We have stringent measures in place
                        to ensure the protection of your financial data during online transactions.

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Usage of Personal Information for Site Improvement and Communications</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">We utilize personally identifiable information to enhance our marketing and promotional
                        initiatives, conduct statistical analyses of site usage, improve our content and product offerings,
                        and tailor the content, layout, and services of our site. These uses are aimed at refining our

                        our site to resolve disputes, address issues, and enforce our Terms & Conditions. Occasionally,
                        we may examine data across multiple users to identify and address problems or disputes. Your
