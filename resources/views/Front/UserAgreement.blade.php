                    <h3 class="mb-4">Tailored Package Holidays</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Our company specializes in creating custom package holidays tailored to your preferences and
                        needs. Typically, our offerings include a variety of combinations of travel services that
                        encompass the entirety of your journey or vacation. These combinations may include pairing a
                        flight with a hotel stay.<br /><br />
                        When you book a package holiday with us, your contract(s) will be formally signed by our
                        company, acting as a representative of the supplier(s) or principal(s) involved in providing the
                        various services. Consequently, we assume responsibility for the execution of the contract(s)
                        and also ensure the necessary financial protection for your package, in accordance with the
                        Package Travel Regulations of 2018.<br /><br />
                        Our company does not bear responsibility for the execution of individual travel services that
                        have been added to an existing, selected, booked, and paid trip or holiday. In such cases, the
                        rights and protections granted to package holidays under the Package Travel Regulations will
                        not apply.<br /><br />
                        Please be aware that on occasion, we may offer packages organized by tour operators or
                        principals, with us acting as their agent. In such cases, the tour operator or principal holds the
                        responsibility for your package, including your financial protection, and we solely act as an
                        agent. Section A of these terms and conditions applies to all bookings of this nature. If the
                        package includes a flight, it will be protected by their ATOL, and you will find the ATOL
                        holder's name and ATOL number in your booking confirmation.
                        For any inquiries related to customer services or your booking, please direct all communications
                        to Customer Services at JAKS Travels Ltd, 211 St Albans Road, Watford, WD24 5BH, United
                        Kingdom, or email us at <a href="mailto:info@jakstravels.co.uk" > info@jakstravels.co.uk</a> or by calling 00441923882275
                        When making your booking we, will arrange for you to enter into a contract with each of the
                        third-party supplier(s) of your travel arrangements (such as tour operator, airline, cruise
                        operator, accommodation provider, car hire provider and transfer provider) as specified on your
                        booking confirmation. Your contract comes into existence once we issue the booking
                        confirmation.<br /><br />
                        Your booking with us is subject to these Booking Conditions and as well as those of the thirdparty suppliers who have their own terms and conditions which govern the services they provide
                        and you’ll be bound by these. In the event of any conflict between a supplier’s terms and
                        conditions and these booking conditions, the supplier’s term, or condition that conflicts with
                        ours will take precedence, unless it is deemed under English law to be invalid or unenforceable,
                        in which case the relevant term or condition in our Booking Conditions will prevail. Some of
                        our suppliers’ conditions may limit or exclude their liability to you and, because they’ll apply
                        to your contract with us, may also limit or exclude our liability to you. Suppliers’ terms and
                        conditions are often subject to international conventions too, which limit their (and our)
                        liability. Copies of the relevant supplier’s terms and conditions and any applicable international
                        conventions are available on request.<br /><br />
                        As an agent, we accept no responsibility for the acts or omissions of the suppliers or for the
                        travel services provided by them</p>

                    <!-- Booking -->
                    <h3 class="mb-4">Booking</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">You have the option to make bookings through various methods:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Online: You can make bookings via our website at <a href="https://www.jakstravels.co.uk/"> www.jakstravels.co.uk </a> comprehensive guidance.</li>
                        <li>Telephone: Bookings can be made by calling us on 00441923882275.</li>
                        <li>In-person: You also have the option to visit our agency premises for bookings</li>
                    </ol><br />
                    It's important to note that all bookings are subject to availability at the time of booking. We
                    cannot assure the availability of any of the travel services we promote, including those featured
                    on our website, at the time you make your booking request. However, once you have submitted
                    a booking request, we will verify and confirm the availability of your selected travel services
                    to you. This confirmation will provide you with assurance regarding the availability of the
                    services you wish to book.<br /><br />
                    When you make a booking online, please note that the order summary email you receive from
                    us does not constitute a contractual acceptance of the supplier's ability to provide the specified
                    travel services. Instead, it serves as an acknowledgment that we have received your offer. If the
                    travel services are available as described on our website, we will subsequently issue a booking
                    confirmation to you.<br /><br />
                    Your contract with us comes into existence and becomes legally binding only upon receipt of
                    this booking confirmation. At this point, you have entered into a legally binding agreement to
                    purchase the specified travel arrangements, which are subject to the supplier's terms and
                    conditions as well as these Booking Conditions. It's important to thoroughly review the terms
                    and conditions associated with your travel arrangements.<br /><br />
                    Ensuring the accuracy of all names listed in the booking confirmation is your responsibility,
                    and they should match the names on the passports of the travelers in your party. Additionally,
                    it is important to review the travel itinerary to ensure that it aligns with your requirements.
                    Please be aware that making changes to travel arrangements becomes increasingly difficult once
                    flight tickets and other travel documents have been issued. Such alterations may also result in
                    additional charges. Therefore, it is essential to carefully review all details in the booking
                    confirmation and make any necessary adjustments before travel documents are issued to avoid
                    inconvenience and extra expenses.<br /><br />
                    Indeed, ensuring the accuracy of all names in the booking confirmation, which should
                    correspond to the names on the passports of the travelers, is your responsibility. Additionally,
                    thoroughly reviewing the travel itinerary to confirm that it meets your requirements is crucial.
                    It's important to note that modifying travel arrangements becomes progressively challenging
                    once flight tickets and other travel documents have been issued. These changes may also lead
                    to additional charges. Therefore, it is imperative to meticulously examine all the information in
                    the booking confirmation and make any needed adjustments before travel documents are issued
                    to prevent any inconvenience and extra costs.

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Travel Protection, Insurance, and Flight Booking Policies</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">ATOL protection<br /><br /><br />
                        When you purchase an ATOL protected flight through us, you will receive an ATOL Certificate.
                        This certificate outlines what is covered by financial protection, where you can find information
                        about its implications for you, and whom to contact in case of issues or complications. During
                        the booking process, you will be informed whether your flight is ATOL protected, and if it is,
                        you will be provided with an ATOL certificate.<br /><br />
                        However, it's important to note that not all of our flights come with ATOL protection. Some
                        flight-only sales are sold by us as an agent for the airline, and in such cases, ATOL protection
                        may not apply. Please make sure to clarify the protection status of your specific flight during
                        the booking process to understand your coverage.<br /><br />
                        SAFI insurance<br /><br /><br />
                        Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance (SAFI) is available for purchase at your discretion,
                        typically at an extra cost, and it is designed to safeguard your payments in case of airline failure.
                        We recommend that you inquire about and review the terms of the SAFI policy to obtain precise
                        details regarding what it covers. This additional insurance can provide you with added financial
                        protection and peace of mind in the event of unforeseen airline issues.<br /><br />
                        Seats<br /><br /><br />
                        Availability of seats and pricing for flights are determined by the discretion of the airline. The
                        flight times displayed are typically provisional and might be subject to changes, in accordance
                        with the airline's booking conditions. It's important to be aware that many airlines have a nonrefundable policy for bookings.<br /><br />
                        Therefore, when making flight reservations, it's advisable to carefully review the terms and
                        conditions set forth by the airline to understand their specific policies regarding availability,
                        pricing, and refundability. This information can help you make an informed decision when
                        booking your flights.<br /><br />
                        Flight Prices:<br /><br /><br />
                        Please note that airfares may change rapidly after the initial quote. To secure the offered fare,
                        we kindly request that you make your payment within one hour of receiving the booking
                        confirmation. In the event that the fare has increased by the time of your payment, you will
                        retain the option to cancel the booking and request a full refund if you choose not to proceed
                        with it.<br /><br />
                        Connecting Flights:<br /><br /><br />
                        It's important to be aware that certain flights may involve layovers or connections through other
                        airports. When booking an indirect flight, we will provide you with comprehensive information
                        regarding any stopovers as part of the booking process.<br /><br />
                        Luggage:<br /><br /><br />
                        The complimentary luggage allowance provided to passengers can vary greatly among different
                        airlines and depending on the chosen route. Our prices encompass the standard luggage
                        allowance permitted by the airline. The specific allowance you are eligible for will be detailed
                        in the booking conditions provided by your chosen airline. It's worth noting that some airlines
                        may permit the addition of extra luggage after the initial booking, and this is contingent upon
                        the terms and conditions of the particular airline, which you should consult for further
                        information.<br /><br />
                        Some airlines consider hold luggage as an optional extra. When you book with such an airline,
                        the cost of hold luggage is not included in our headline prices, and you will have the option to
                        add this service during the booking process. If you decide not to include hold luggage, you will
                        still be entitled to the standard hand luggage allowance, typically ranging from 5 to 10
                        kilograms, as specified in the airline's booking conditions. It's important to review your booking
                        confirmation for the exact hand luggage allowance.<br /><br />
                        Please be aware that your hand luggage should adhere to the dimensions permitted by the airline
                        for carry-on items. For more details, please consult the airline's booking conditions.
                        Additionally, it's essential to note that many countries, including the UK, have restrictions on
                        importing food, plants, and animal products. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that you do not
                        carry any restricted items when traveling.<br /><br />
                        Check-In Information:<br /><br /><br />
                        Details regarding the check-in process can be found in the booking confirmation email that we
                        send to you. Some airlines may mandate online check-in, and failure to complete this check-in
                        online may result in airport check-in fees, which you will be responsible for covering. It is your
                        sole responsibility to adhere to the airline's check-in procedures and ensure you check in well
                        in advance of your flight.<br /><br />
                        To allow sufficient time for security screenings and check-in processes, we strongly advise
                        arriving at the airport at least 3 hours before your scheduled departure time. Please be aware
                        that check-in counters typically close 60 minutes before departure.

                        Please note that all accommodation ratings provided are sourced directly from the respective
                        suppliers or are based on our own internal assessments, which take into account industry

                        can also vary among different suppliers.<br /><br />
                        Accuracy of Ratings:<br /><br />
                        While we have taken reasonable measures to determine the official ratings of the
                        accommodations, which are included in the accommodation descriptions on our website, we
                        cannot guarantee the absolute accuracy of all ratings provided. We encourage you to consider
                        our ratings as general guidance and be prepared for potential variations in standards and
                        services, especially when traveling to different countries or booking with various suppliers.
                        Your experience may ultimately depend on a variety of factors, including personal preferences
                        and expectations.

                    </ol><br />
                    Note: When booking online, it's important to remember that your payment should be made after
                    you receive an email containing a booking confirmation. At this point, your contract with us is
                    established, and you have entered into a legally binding agreement to purchase the specified
                    travel arrangements. This agreement is subject to both the terms and conditions of the supplier
                    and these Booking Conditions.<br />
                    The cost of your holiday covers all taxes and known additional fees, charges, and expenses at
                    the time of your booking. In cases where it is not possible to calculate these additional taxes,
                    fees, charges, and expenses before you make a booking, we will provide you with an estimate
                    of the potential additional costs you may still need to incur.<br /><br />
                    To secure your selected travel arrangements, you will need to make a payment, which could be
                    either an instalment or deposit towards the full price, or the entire balance, depending on the
                    timing of your booking in relation to the travel departure date. Additionally, you will be
                    responsible for covering any relevant insurance premiums and booking fees.<br /><br />
                    If only a part payment is made, the balance must be paid on or before the due date that we
                    stipulate in your booking confirmation. Failing to do so may result in cancellation of the
                    booking by the principal(s) or supplier(s) and may incur cancellation fees set out in their terms
                    and conditions.<br /><br />
                    With the exception of bookings protected by an ATOL, all funds you provide to us for travel
                    arrangements will be securely held on behalf of the respective supplier or principal, unless
                    otherwise specified in their terms and conditions.
                    For bookings protected by an ATOL, any money you transfer to us is held by us on behalf of
                    and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust at all times. However, this is subject
                    to our responsibility to transfer the funds to the ATOL holder, provided that the ATOL holder
                    remains financially secure.<br /><br />
                    If, unfortunately, the ATOL holder does experience financial difficulties, any money held by us
                    at that time or received from the consumer subsequently will continue to be held by us on behalf
                    of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust, without the obligation to transfer
                    that money to the ATOL holder.<br /><br />
                    Non-Flight Package In cases where we serve as an agent for a package organized by a third
                    party, we will inform you about the financial protection put in place by the organizer in the
                    event of the organizer's insolvency.

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Travel documents and Flight Reconfirmation Guidelines</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">Documents delivery: Upon the full payment of your booking, you can expect to receive all your
                        travel documents, including tickets and insurance policies, via email within 48-72 hours. If
                        preferred, we can also arrange to send them to you by postal mail upon request. In situations
                        where last-minute bookings are made, we can expedite the dispatch of documents within 24
                        hours.<br /><br />
                        It's essential to be aware that once we've posted the documents to you, we will not assume
                        liability for any losses unless they are a result of our negligence. If, in such instances, you
                        require the reissuance of tickets or other documents, you will be responsible for covering any
                        associated costs. Please note that document reissuance can only be facilitated up to 7 days
                        before your scheduled departure date. Should you require an alternative delivery method, such
                        as courier services, this can be arranged at your own expense.<br /><br />
                        Ensure that all your travel documents, including passports, visas, and insurance, are in order,
                        and arrive at the airport well in advance of your departure for the check-in process. It's important
                        to note that it may be required to reconfirm your flight with Get A Flight before your departure.
                        We recommend that you request the airline's contact details from us so that you can directly
                        check with the airline, if necessary, for any changes to your scheduled itinerary. It's advisable
                        to reconfirm your flight at least 72 hours before your outbound flight. When reconfirming,
                        please make a note of any reference numbers or contact names.<br /><br />
                        Failure to reconfirm your flight could result in denial of boarding, and you are unlikely to
                        receive any refunds in such cases. Your compliance with these reconfirmation guidelines is
                        crucial to ensuring a smooth travel experience.

                    <!-- User’s Payment Assurance -->
                    <h3 class="mb-4">User’s Payment Assurance</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">For some (but not all) of our flight-only services, we offer financial protection through our Air
                        Travel Organiser's Licence (ATOL). When you purchase a flight that is ATOL protected from
                        us, you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This certificate provides details on what is financially
                        protected, where to find information about what this protection means for you, and how to
                        contact the relevant authorities in case of any issues or complications.<br /><br />
                        Flights that we sell as an authorized ticket agent for the airline do not have ATOL protection.
                        We will inform you during the booking process whether your flight is ATOL protected and
                        provide you with an ATOL Certificate. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate, it means that
                        your flight is not covered by ATOL protection.<br /><br />
                        In cases where we sell a flight package as an agent on behalf of the organizer, your protection
                        is provided by the organizer's ATOL. Your booking confirmation will include the name and
                        ATOL number of the ATOL holder.<br /><br />
                        When your flight is ATOL protected, either we or the service providers you have booked will
                        deliver the services you've purchased, or provide a suitable alternative. In instances where
                        neither we nor the supplier can do so due to insolvency, another ATOL holder may step in to
                        offer the services or an appropriate substitute at no extra cost to you. You agree to accept that,
                        under such circumstances, the alternative ATOL holder will fulfill those obligations, and you
                        are responsible for settling any outstanding payments owed under your contract with that
                        alternative ATOL holder.<br /><br />
                        However, it's important to acknowledge that in certain situations, appointing an alternative
                        ATOL holder may not be feasible. In such cases, you will have the right to make a claim under
                        the ATOL scheme, or with your credit card issuer where applicable.<br /><br />
                        If, for reasons of insolvency, we or the suppliers specified on your ATOL certificate are unable
                        to provide the listed services or a suitable alternative (through an alternative ATOL holder or
                        by other means), the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to you or provide
                        you with a benefit under the ATOL scheme. As part of this process, you agree to fully assign
                        any claims you may have or may in the future have related to the non-provision of these
                        services, including any claims against us, the travel agent, or your credit card issuer if
                        applicable, in exchange for such a payment or benefit.<br /><br />
                        Furthermore, you also agree that these claims can be reassigned to another entity if that entity
                        has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme. This ensures that your rights and
                        claims are properly managed in the event of service disruptions due to insolvency.

                    <h3 class="mb-4">User’s Rights and Obligations</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">You must ensure you are familiar with and fulfill all the necessary requirements for traveling to
                        and through your chosen destination. This includes but is not limited to aspects such as passport
                        and visa requirements, transit visas, Esta visas, health conditions, required vaccinations, and
                        any specific requirements for traveling with children.<br /><br />
                        While we can offer general information regarding passport and visa requirements as well as
                        health-related formalities in your destination countries, it remains your responsibility to
                        independently verify, fulfill, and confirm these requirements specific to your circumstances
                        through the relevant Embassies and/or Consulates. Additionally, it is crucial to consult with
                        your doctor when necessary. Keep in mind that requirements can change, so it is imperative that
                        you verify the most current information well in advance of your departure. It is worth noting
                        that for all air travel within the British Isles, airlines typically mandate photographic
                        identification, such as a passport or a driver's license.<br /><br />
                        The majority of countries now have a requirement that passports remain valid for a minimum
                        of 6 months beyond your return date.<br /><br />
                        In certain countries, a transit visa may be necessary for travelers passing through the country
                        on connecting flights. We will inform you if a transit visa is required for your specific travel
                        arrangements. Additionally, we recommend checking the UK government foreign travel
                        website at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice"> www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice </a> the most current information on visa entry
                        requirements.<br /><br />
                        An ESTA visa is a mandatory requirement for all travelers bound for the USA, including those
                        transiting through the USA. Similarly, an ETA visa is a necessary requirement for all travelers
                        heading to Australia, as well as those transiting through Australia.
                        If your flight involves a change between two separate airports along the route, it is your
                        responsibility to arrange the transfer to the correct airport and, if applicable, to arrange a transit
                        visa.<br /><br />
                        For travel to the USA, please note that special conditions apply, and all passengers must possess
                        individual machine-readable passports. You can find more information at
                        <a href="http://www.uk.usembassy.gov./"> www.uk.usembassy.gov.</a> <br /><br />
                        For European holidays, it is advisable to obtain a completed and issued form EHIC (European
                        Health Insurance Card) before your departure.<br /><br />
                        If you are a non-British passport holder, including other EU nationals, it is essential to seek upto-date advice on passport and visa requirements from the Embassy, High Commission, or
                        Consulate of your destination country or countries through which you will be traveling.
                        For current travel advice regarding security, please visit the Foreign and Commonwealth Office

                        You are responsible for disclosing any medical conditions or reduced mobility to us before
                        making your booking. This allows us to assess the suitability of the trip to meet your specific
                        requirements. <br /><br />
                        Regarding pregnancy, it's important to note that most airlines retain the right to deny boarding
                        to women who are in advanced stages of pregnancy. Therefore, we kindly request that you
                        inform us at the time of booking if you or a member of your party is pregnant, or if pregnancy
                        occurs before your departure. This will allow us to verify the airline's policy and provide you
                        with appropriate guidance.<br /><br />
                        Please be aware that some airlines may require a medical certificate from a doctor confirming
                        the passenger's fitness to travel during pregnancy. It's essential to follow these guidelines and
                        provide the necessary information. We cannot accept responsibility for any individual who is
                        denied travel due to pregnancy if we have not been informed of the pregnancy or if our advice
                        has not been followed.<br /><br />
                        When children are traveling without their parents or are unaccompanied, airlines typically
                        require additional documentation. It is crucial to notify us in advance if your child will be
                        traveling in such a manner. Failure to obtain the necessary documentation may result in refusal
                        to embark or delays, and it's important to note that you are responsible for any such issues that
                        arise due to a failure to secure the required documentation.<br /><br />
                        Please be also aware that, in accordance with Air Navigation Orders, for a child to qualify for
                        infant status, they must be under 2 years of age as of the date of their return flight.
                        We want to emphasize that we do not assume any responsibility if you are unable to travel or
                        experience any other losses due to your failure to comply with passport, visa, immigration
                        requirements, or health formalities. By engaging in our travel services, you agree to reimburse
                        us for any fines or other losses that we may incur as a result of your non-compliance with these
                        requirements or formalities. It is crucial to ensure that you meet all the necessary travel and
                        health-related obligations to avoid any inconveniences or financial liabilities.<br /><br />
                        As a traveler, it is expected that you conduct yourself in a respectful and appropriate manner,
                        ensuring that you do not disrupt the enjoyment of others. If, in the opinion of the

                    You have the responsibility to stay informed about travel safety advisories issued by the Foreign
                    Office for the countries and regions you plan to visit. It's crucial to consider this advice when

                    <p class="mb-4">Your contract for travel services is established with the supplier/principal, and their respective
                        booking conditions govern the terms of your agreement. In our role as your agent, our
                        responsibilities are restricted to making bookings in line with your instructions. We assume no
                        responsibility for the actual provision of the travel services. While we strive to provide you with
                        accurate information about travel arrangements in good faith, we do not accept responsibility

                        all travelers in the booking are affected).<br /><br />
                        It's important to note that we do not exclude or limit liability for instances of death or personal
                        injury resulting from our negligence or that of any of our employees while performing their job

                    <h3 class="mb-4">Recommendations</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">We highly recommend that you obtain adequate travel insurance to provide coverage for
                        yourself and your travel party. Many of the principals or suppliers of the travel services we offer
                        may require you to have travel insurance as a booking condition. Additionally, specific
                        destinations may mandate the purchase of travel insurance.<br /><br />
                        As a minimum, we suggest that your insurance policy covers:<br />
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li> Costs associated with trip cancellation by you.</li>
                        <li>Expenses related to medical assistance, including repatriation, in the event of an
                            accident or illness.</li>
                        <li> Loss of baggage and money.</li>
                        <li> Other potential travel-related expenses.</li>
                    </ol><br />
                    Having comprehensive travel insurance can provide you with peace of mind and financial
                    protection during your travels

                    <p class="mb-4">You have the flexibility to cancel your booking at any time. To initiate a cancellation, please
                        send a written request to Customer Services at JAKS Travels Ltd, 211 St Albans Road, Watford,
                        WD24 5BH, United Kingdom, or email us at <a href="mailto:info@jakstravels.co.uk" > info@jakstravels.co.uk</a>. Please note that the
                        cancellation will only take effect upon our receipt of your request.<br /><br />
                        Upon receiving your cancellation request, the principal(s) or supplier(s) may impose a
                        cancellation fee as specified in their terms and conditions. The cancellation fees can range up
                        to 100% of the total price of the travel service, depending on when the cancellation occurs. It's
                        important to note that most bookings are non-refundable unless otherwise stated, beginning
                        from the date of booking.<br /><br />
                        Additionally, please be aware of the following:<br />
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li> If you, as the passenger, choose to cancel the flight, we will incur administration costs
                            in processing your request, and therefore, an administration fee of £75 per passenger
                            will be charged.</li>
                        <li>If the flight is canceled by the airline, an administration fee of £25 per passenger will
                            be applied in processing your cancellation request. <br /><br />In the event of flight cancellations by the airline due to COVID restrictions, you will be
                            provided with the following options:
                        </li><br />
                        <li>Open Ticket: Depending on the airline's policy, you may be eligible for an open ticket.</li>
                        <li> Date Changes: Changes can be made to your booking, with charges potentially
                            applicable based on the airline's policy.</li>
                        <li>Refund: Refunds will be issued, with a deduction of a £25 admin/supplier fee per
                            passenger.</li>
                    </ol><br />
                    For partially used tickets, please note that as a travel agent, we can submit a refund request on
                    your behalf. However, the refund amount is subject to the discretion of the airline or supplier.

                    <p class="mb-4">As your travel agent, we are here to assist you with any complaints or concerns you may have.
                        You can send your request via post to Customer Services JAKS Travels Ltd, 211 St Albans
                        Road, Watford, WD24 5BH, United Kingdom, or email us at <a href="mailto:info@jakstravels.co.uk" > info@jakstravels.co.uk</a> by calling

                        It's important to note that the contract(s) for your travel arrangements is established between
                        you and the principal(s) or supplier(s) of those services. Therefore, any inquiries or issues
                        related to your travel arrangements should initially be directed to them. In the event of a problem
                        during your holiday, please report it promptly to the principal/supplier, their local supplier, or
                        agent at your destination. Following this procedure is crucial, as it allows the principal/supplier
                        the opportunity to investigate and address your complaint effectively. Failure to do so may
                        impact the amount of compensation you are entitled to or result in no compensation at all.
                        If you wish to file a complaint upon your return home, please contact the principal/supplier.
                        You can find their name, address, and contact details in the confirmation documents we provide
                        you. We are more than willing to assist you with this process if needed—simply get in touch
                        with JAKS Travels Ltd, 211 St Albans Road, Watford, WD24 5BH, United Kingdom, or email
                        us at <a href="mailto:info@jakstravels.co.uk" > info@jakstravels.co.uk</a> by calling 01923882275.<br /><br />
                        If a resolution cannot be reached and the matter involves us or another ABTA Member, you
                        have the option to utilize ABTA's ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) scheme, which is

                    <p class="mb-4">Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances:<br /><br />
                        We want to emphasize that we will not be held liable or responsible for compensating you if
                        our contractual obligations are disrupted by circumstances beyond our or the supplier's control.
                        These situations, known as "Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances," are events that
                        could not have been prevented even with the implementation of reasonable measures. Examples
                        of such circumstances include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism, warfare (and threats
                        thereof), civil unrest, significant health risks, natural disasters (like floods, earthquakes, or
                        extreme weather conditions), government actions, industrial disputes, labor strikes, port
                        closures, nuclear or chemical incidents, technical transport problems, air traffic control strikes,
                        flight cancellations, and similar events that neither we nor the supplier(s) can control.<br /><br />
                        Brexit Implications:<br /><br />
                        We recognize that the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union may have
                        implications for certain travel services. This could encompass potential disruptions to flight
                        routes, access to ports and airports, and changes in visa requirements for British citizens
                        traveling to, within, or through the EU. Please be assured that we are closely monitoring this
                        situation, and if we become aware of any confirmed bookings that will be affected, we will
                        promptly inform our customers.<br /><br />
                        However, it's crucial to understand that Brexit is an unprecedented event entirely beyond our
                        control. Therefore, any resulting changes will be considered as "Unavoidable and Extraordinary
                        Circumstances," as explained above. While we will make every effort to offer suitable
                        alternative arrangements or refunds where feasible, we will not be liable to provide
                        compensation in such cases.

                        We will use your personal information, including sensitive data, for the purpose of arranging

                        providing your travel services as necessary to facilitate your trip. In some instances, we may be

                        or immigration. Certain details may also be shared with security or credit-checking companies.
                        If your travel includes the United States, we may need to share this information with US
                        Customs and Border Protection to assist in preventing terrorism and other transnational serious
                        crimes. When traveling outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will ensure that your
                        data is transferred to suppliers in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation
                        (GDPR) requirements related to such transfers.<br /><br />

                        booking form may be shared with suppliers and individuals necessary to facilitate your travel
                        arrangements."
